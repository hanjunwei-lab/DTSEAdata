#' @title Drug prediction results on trimmed graphs after enrichment
#' @description We we simulated 5 node failures and 5 link failures with 50
#' repeats in each condition to measure the robustness of the graph.
#' @format A list with 500 items, including 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% failures,
#' and node and link failures.
